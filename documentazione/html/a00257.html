<pre class="fragment">==============================================================================
                      ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================
  [..]
  The I2C HAL driver can be used as follows:

  (#) Declare a I2C_HandleTypeDef handle structure, for example:
      I2C_HandleTypeDef  hi2c;

  (#)Initialize the I2C low level resources by implementing the HAL_I2C_MspInit() API:
      (##) Enable the I2Cx interface clock
      (##) I2C pins configuration
          (+++) Enable the clock for the I2C GPIOs
          (+++) Configure I2C pins as alternate function open-drain
      (##) NVIC configuration if you need to use interrupt process
          (+++) Configure the I2Cx interrupt priority
          (+++) Enable the NVIC I2C IRQ Channel
      (##) DMA Configuration if you need to use DMA process
          (+++) Declare a DMA_HandleTypeDef handle structure for the transmit or receive channel
          (+++) Enable the DMAx interface clock using
          (+++) Configure the DMA handle parameters
          (+++) Configure the DMA Tx or Rx channel
          (+++) Associate the initialized DMA handle to the hi2c DMA Tx or Rx handle
          (+++) Configure the priority and enable the NVIC for the transfer complete interrupt on
                the DMA Tx or Rx channel

  (#) Configure the Communication Clock Timing, Own Address1, Master Addressing mode, Dual Addressing mode,
      Own Address2, Own Address2 Mask, General call and Nostretch mode in the hi2c Init structure.

  (#) Initialize the I2C registers by calling the HAL_I2C_Init(), configures also the low level Hardware
      (GPIO, CLOCK, NVIC...etc) by calling the customized HAL_I2C_MspInit(&amp;hi2c) API.

  (#) To check if target device is ready for communication, use the function HAL_I2C_IsDeviceReady()

  (#) For I2C IO and IO MEM operations, three operation modes are available within this driver :

  *** Polling mode IO operation ***
  =================================
  [..]
    (+) Transmit in master mode an amount of data in blocking mode using HAL_I2C_Master_Transmit()
    (+) Receive in master mode an amount of data in blocking mode using HAL_I2C_Master_Receive()
    (+) Transmit in slave mode an amount of data in blocking mode using HAL_I2C_Slave_Transmit()

  [..]
    (+) Write an amount of data in blocking mode to a specific memory address using HAL_I2C_Mem_Write()
    (+) Read an amount of data in blocking mode from a specific memory address using HAL_I2C_Mem_Read()

         add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_I2C_MasterTxCpltCallback()
    (+) Receive in master mode an amount of data in non-blocking mode using HAL_I2C_Master_Receive_IT()

         add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_I2C_MasterRxCpltCallback()
    (+) Transmit in slave mode an amount of data in non-blocking mode using HAL_I2C_Slave_Transmit_IT()
    (+) At transmission end of transfer, HAL_I2C_SlaveTxCpltCallback() is executed and user can

         add his own code by customization of function pointer HAL_I2C_AbortCpltCallback()
    (+) Discard a slave I2C process communication using __HAL_I2C_GENERATE_NACK() macro.
         This action will inform Master to generate a Stop condition to discard the communication.

  ==============================================
  [..]
    (@) These interfaces allow to manage a sequential transfer with a repeated start condition
        when a direction change during transfer

    (++) I2C_LAST_FRAME: Sequential usage, this option allow to manage a sequance with a restart condition, address
                          and with new data to transfer if the direction change or manage only the new data to transfer
